# Job Application Portal

## 📄 Project Description
The **Job Application Portal** is a modern, full-stack web application designed to connect job seekers with employers efficiently.

## 📌 Features
- **User Authentication**  
  Secure registration and login for job seekers and recruiters using JWT authentication.

- **Job Posting & Management**  
  Recruiters can create, update, and delete job listings with details such as title, description, required skills, location, and salary.

- **Job Search & Filters**  
  Job seekers can search jobs by keywords and filter by category, location, or other parameters.

- **Application Submission**  
  Users can apply for jobs by submitting their information and resumes via the frontend interface.

- **Application Tracking**  
  Recruiters can view applications for their job postings and manage candidates effectively.
